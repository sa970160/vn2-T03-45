Python OOps :

OOPs :-- Object Oriented Programming System

In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. 
It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. 
The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that 
no other part of the code can access this data. 


Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming :

1. Class
2. Objects
3. Methods
4. Inheritance
5. Polymorphism
6. Data Abstraction
7. Encapsulation



-----1) Class-----

A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. 
It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. 


-----2) Objects-----

The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object like a mouse, 
keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc.

An Object consists of :

State :--  It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.

Behavior :-- It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.

Identity :-- It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.



#################### The __init__ method #######################

The __init__ method is similar to constructor. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. 
The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object. 


------3) Method -------

The method is a function that is associated with an object. In Python, a method is not unique to class instances.
Any object type can have methods.


------4) Inheritance ------------

Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that 
derives properties is called the derived class or base class and the class from which the properties are being derived 
is called the base class or parent class.


-----5) Polymorphism --------

Polymorphism simply means having many forms. For example, we need to determine if the given species of birds fly or not, 
using polymorphism we can do this using a single function.


-----6) Data Abstraction -----

Data abstraction and encapsulation both are often used as synonyms. Both are nearly synonyms because data abstraction is 
achieved through encapsulation.Abstraction is used to hide internal details and show only functionalities.


-----7) Encapsulation ------

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping 
data and the methods that work on data within one unit.
